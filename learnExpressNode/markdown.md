**HOTEL NAME – Workplace Pension Scheme**

Dear Employee Name

To help people save more for their retirement, the government requires
employers to enrol their workers into a workplace pension scheme. This
applies to those workers who aren’t already in one, and who

-   earn over £10,000 a year (£833.33 a month);

-   are aged 22 or over; and

-   are under State Pension age.

Now that you meet the above criteria we will be automatically enrolling
you into our workplace pension on \[insert date\]

We have chosen The People’s Pension as our workplace pension scheme for
you, which is provided by B&CE, an experienced provider of workplace
pensions in the UK. We will share relevant information with B&CE so that
they can administer the pension scheme.

***Why is this happening?***

The government’s aim is to get more people to have another income, on
top of the State Pension, when they come to retire. The full basic State
Pension in 2016-17 is £155.65 a week for a single person.

Employers are enrolling their workers automatically into a scheme to
make it easier for people to start saving.

***What happens next?***

You will receive a pack from The Peoples Pension confirming you have
been automatically enrolled. This pack will confirm the amount that will
be deducted from your salary in \[insert month of first deduction\], the
amount \[company name\] will contribute to your pot and how much tax
relief will be added to make up your total monthly pension contribution.

The pack will also confirm details of how to opt out if you do not wish
to be enrolled in the pension scheme. Please follow the instructions in
the pack.

***Where to go for further information ***

You may have questions about workplace pensions and saving for your
retirement. More information on pensions and saving for later life can
be found on: **<https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions> **

appropriate person in hotel\]

Yours sincerely
